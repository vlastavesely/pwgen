.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pwgen
is a simple utility to generate random strings composed of characters from
different character sets. You can freely combine multiple character sets or
specify your own. There are four default character sets built in:
uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or all printable
.BR ASCII (7)
characters. As the source of entropy, the Linux
.I /dev/urandom
file is used so the strings should be reasonably random.
