Password Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program is a simple utility to generate random strings composed
of characters from different character sets. You can freely combine multiple
character sets or specify your own. There are four default character sets built
in: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or all printable ASCII
characters. As the source of entropy, the Linux /dev/urandom file is used so
the strings should be reasonably random.
